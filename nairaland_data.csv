Nobody Has Managed To Run Nigeria Better Than Igbos"So we started off in 1960 as three semi-autonomous Regions, each controlling their resources and paying the government at the centre. We had Nnamdi Azikiwe as non-executive President and commander in Chief, assisted by Prime minister Balewa. Nigerian was already unravelling with political chaos and infighting, but much better than what obtains today. In 1963, a 4th Region was added  In 1966, the first coup occured and led to the emergence of General Ironsi. He was there for only 6 months during which time he was running around the country looking for 'one Nigeria' , however he still kept the 4 Regions and allowed them resource control. Some lie that he abolished the Regions with Decree 34, but thats people who never read the Decree to realise it was just a civil service matter. Nobody has ever accused Ironsi's regime of being brutal  But the real destruction of Nigeria started when Gowon came in after Ironsi. In a blink of an eye, Gowon abolishes all 4 Regions with Decree 14, creates 12 new states, abolishes resource control with Decree 15 and ushers Nigeria into full blown unitary rule. He also causes a civil war by breaking the agreement he signed in Ghana with Ojukwu and squanders Nigerias oil wealth on frivolities  Murtala and Obasanjo take over from him, increase the 12 unitary states to 19, waste Nigerias scarce resources, had over to Shagari who faces drop in oil prices, economic stagnation and public unrest  Buhari kicks Shagari out, institutes a brutal military regime that locked many up and conducted several public executions.  IBB comes in, increased the already useless 19 unitary states to 30, institutes a brutal regime, causes economic meltdown with Structural Adjustment Program(SAP) and annuls the election he conducted, hands over a lame duck interim national government to Shonekan  Abacha kicks out Shonekan, increases the 30 unitary states to 36, institutes a brutal military regime that that cracks down on all voices of dissent and plots to succeed himself in a civilian government.  The sudden death of Abacha ushers a period of civilian rule which saw the come back of former military dictators such as Obasanjo, Buhari and the Yaradua family. Their collective work has made Nigeria world poverty capital and 8th most terrorised country on earth  We now have Bola Tinubu who in just 6 months, has practically wrecked the economy, increased inflation and devalued the Naira  Safe to say that the best times were Zik and Ironsi times, all others could not run Nigeria better"{'comment_topic': 'Nobody Has Managed To Run Nigeria Better Than Igbos', 'comment_text': 'Zik and ironsi the two collosal failures..they did nothing more than the destruction of ibo race....'}, {'comment_topic': 'Nobody Has Managed To Run Nigeria Better Than Igbos', 'comment_text': 'How do you think the owners won’t be better, Igbo own Nigeria'}, {'comment_topic': 'Nobody Has Managed To Run Nigeria Better Than Igbos', 'comment_text': 'TrueWe can see how developed the Eldorado Alaigbo is today.

Nairalanders, Please Wake Up!"I noticed over the years that the people we blame for our poverty inflicted predicament are actually winning because we do not seek the right thing. Currently as it stands, most of us in the country cannot even afford the basic necessities of life. The fact is, majority of users even on Nairaland are broke people. It goes thus that who we are doesn't matter... Our financial status doesn't matter..... Our religious interests doesn't matter.... What really matters is victory against squalor and poverty which was placed upon us by leaders only a handful of us chose.....  The issue here is the 'divide and rule' tactic that has encouraged these situations and in order to really conquer the 'divide and rule' tactic, we need a better tactic which would be the 'UNITE AND LEAD' tactic. These people rip us off when we see ourselves as Hausa, Igbo, Fulani, Yoruba amongst others.... Nigeria as an entity was not designed to serve all these groups aforementioned, but to serve Nigerians(who really do not exist), that's why the country only truly serve no one, albeit it doesn't mean the entity is not being used as an avenue to wreck havoc on the groups. In a nutshell, let's all agree to the fact that we all suffer and look for people who are also suffering to represent the interests of their fellows in the same predicament instead of empowering businessmen who have a little money to invest in politics. Remember that an investment is headed by a BOSS while services are rendered by PEOPLE. Let's create, and empower our own leaders instead of BOSSES whenever we are out there choosing....   P.S. Tinubu won this election with a whole lot of funds, it would have taken billions to refute his leadership if well spent, for instance...  If we citizens did not wait for the incumbent government to give us information about our own votes, the results cannot be tampered with....  It is your right to film election proceedings (especially vote counting at your polling units)  Upload such videos consistently on social media platforms (you can create dedicated channels for each polling units)  If there are evidences, INEC staffs cannot accept bribes as we would have ethical rights to mob their families....

Preparing The East For A Post Nigeria Future 5"My previous post on this series, Preparing The East for a Post Nigeria Future 4 - www.nairaland.com/1340291/preparing-east-post-nigeria-future - was unfairly moved to the sectarian politics section. However with the last two posts ( www.nairaland.com/1333111/preparing-east-post-nigeria-future and www.nairaland.com/1340291/preparing-east-post-nigeria-future ) talking politics, and the two preceding those posts ( www.nairaland.com/1248907/preparing-east-post-nigeria-future and www.nairaland.com/1331718/preparing-east-post-nigeria-future ) talking about economics, I wish to return to the economic framework on Biafra. This time, we are talking more about the philosophy under which Biafran economy should be run.  Igbo philosophy believes in live and let live. 'Let the eagle perch, let the kite perch . . .' and whoever goes against that order must be punished. This consideration is important in a capitalist economy. Companies and economic sectors fight for dominance. But, for the continuous operation of capitalism, balance must be maintained. We know Biafrans do not tolerate monopoly and state interference in the free market, so we may need antitrust regulation in the future to protect the right of small businesses. But how do we prevent one sector from upturning the other? How do we prevent financial services from overtaking manufacturing like the case in the UK? How do we avoid letting oil exploration and the exploitation of other minerals overtake productive parts of the economy as is the case with Nigeria and was the case for the Dutch? How do we prevent the Biafran military from dominating budget expenditure like is the case with the United States?"{'comment_topic': 'Preparing The East For A Post Nigeria Future 5', 'comment_text': 'I am going to kick off what I hope would be a rich, stimulating intellectual discourse by suggesting that it should be government policy - of the independent Biafran central bank - to regulate the financial sector. The major reason that interest rates are high in most African countries is because big-time borrowers refuse to repay the banks and they are not punished as these borrowers have political clout. The cost of the amount lost is past unto small-scale borrowers. This must be stopped. The Biafran people have to be aware of any politician getting into bed with private businessmen and vote against such politicians.'}, {'comment_topic': 'Preparing The East For A Post Nigeria Future 5', 'comment_text': 'Space bookedBRB'}, {'comment_topic': 'Preparing The East For A Post Nigeria Future 5', 'comment_text': 'booked'}, {'comment_topic': 'Preparing The East For A Post Nigeria Future 5', 'comment_text': 'The main thing should be to tax everything.

This will remove a lot of yeye cowardice afflicting some people and making them shut up when they should speak out.There is a lot of value in what you said. Taxation is crucial. Of course, 85% tax on anything would not work, but I get your idea. You also have to understand the dynamics of money and power. When one sector, like oil and gas, becomes influential due to wealth, they would have the resources to lobby against high taxes. That is the issue America is facing now. Some are lobbying in favour of renewable energy, but how many people think of the similar abuses to the system that sector would wreak when they become 'Big Energy'. It's not that easy to regulate powerful interest. The citizenry have to be involved consistently and keep alert against abuses that can even endanger a democracy.Your second suggestion about enlisting Biafran youth in the army like is done in Israel is valuable to me, but for a different reason than what you mention. No doubt, Biafra should invest in futuristic technologies, drones, robotics, efficient weaponry, automated tanks, stealth systems, etc that makes defending the realm light on the budget. But still, the article on New York Times shows there is a danger on relying heavily on technology for warfare, and that is the seduction of engaging in war by political leaders - www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/opinion/americans-and-their-military-drifting-apart.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0'}"False"
AWO knew the truth about biafra but he chose to betray (classified document)"Speech by Chief Obafemi Awolowo made to the Western leaders of thought, in Ibadan, 1 May 1967. (Culled from Daily Times, 2 May 1967) and quoted in 'Crisis and Conflict in Nigeria (Volume 1), January 1966-July 1971' by A. H. M. Kirk-Greene  Awolowo Promises West will secede if the East does in a speech to western leaders -------------------------------------------------------------------  The aim of a leader should be the welfare of the people whom he leads. I have used 'welfare' to denote the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the people. With this aim fixed unflinchingly and unchangeably before my eyes I consider it my duty to Yoruba people in particular and to Nigerians in general, to place four imperatives before you this morning. Two of them are categorical and two are conditional. Only a peaceful solution must be found to arrest the present worsening stalemate and restore normalcy. The Eastern Region must be encouraged to remain part of the Federation. If the Eastern Region is allowed by acts of omission or commission to secede from or opt out of Nigeria, then the Western Region and Lagos must also stay out of the Federation. The people of Western Nigeria and Lagos should participate in the ad hoc committee or any similar body only on the basis of absolute equality with the other regions of the Federation.  I would like to comment briefly on these four imperatives. There has, of late, been a good deal of sabre rattling in some parts of the country. Those who advocate the use force for the settlement of our present problems should stop a little and reflect. I can see no vital and abiding principle involved in any war between the North and the East. If the East attacked the North, it would be for purpose of revenge pure and simple. Any claim to the contrary would be untenable. If it is claimed that such a war is being waged for the purpose of recovering the real and personal properties left behind in the North by Easterners two insuperable points are obvious. Firstly, the personal effects left behind by Easterners have been wholly looted or destroyed, and can no longer be physically recovered. Secondly, since the real properties are immovable in case of recovery of them can only be by means of forcible military occupation of those parts of the North in which these properties are situated. On the other hand, if the North attacked the East, it could only be for the purpose of further strengthening and entrenching its position of dominance in the country.  If it is claimed that an attack on the East is going to be launched by the Federal Government and not by the North as such and that it is designed to ensure the unity and integrity of the Federation, two other insuperable points also become obvious. First, if a war against the East becomes a necessity it must be agreed to unanimously by the remaining units of the Federation. In this connection, the West, Mid- West and Lagos have declared their implacable opposition to the use of force in solving the present problem. In the face of such declarations by three out of remaining four territories of Nigeria, a war against the East could only be a war favoured by the North alone. Second, if the true purpose of such a war is to preserve the unity and integrity of the Federation, then these ends can be achieved by the very simple devices of implementing the recommendation of the committee which met on August 9 1966, as reaffirmed by a decision of the military leaders at Aburi on January 5 1967 as well as by accepting such of the demands of the East, West, Mid-West and Lagos as are manifestly reasonable, and essential for assuring harmonious relationships and peaceful co-existence between them and their brothers and sisters in the North.   Some knowledgeable persons have likened an attack on the East to Lincoln's war against the southern states in America. Two vital factors distinguish Lincoln's campaign from the one now being contemplated in Nigeria. The first is that the American civil war was aimed at the abolition of slavery - that is the liberation of millions of Negroes who were then still being used as chattels and worse than domestic animals. The second factor is that Lincoln and others in the northern states were English-speaking people waging a war of good conscience and humanity against their fellow nationals who were also English speaking. A war against the East in which Northern soldiers are predominant, will only unite the Easterners or the Ibos against their attackers, strengthen them in their belief that they are not wanted by the majority of their fellow-Nigerians, and finally push them out of the Federation.  We have been told that an act of secession on the part of the East would be a signal, in the first instance, for the creation of the COR state by decree, which would be backed, if need be, by the use of force. With great respect, I have some dissenting observations to make on this declaration. There are 11 national or linguistic groups in the COR areas with a total population of 5.3 millions. These national groups are as distinct from one another as the Ibos are distinct from them or from the Yorubas or Hausas. Of the 11, the Efik/Ibibio/Annang national group are 3.2 million strong as against the Ijaws who are only about 700,000 strong. Ostensibly, the remaining nine national group number 1.4 millions. But when you have subtracted the Ibo inhabitants from among them, what is left ranges from the Ngennis who number only 8,000 to the Ogonis who are 220,000 strong. A decree creating a COR state without a plebiscite to ascertain the wishes of the peoples in the area, would only amount to subordinating the minority national groups in the state to the dominance of the Efik/Ibibio/Annang national group. It would be perfectly in order to create a Calabar state or a Rivers state by decree, and without a plebiscite. Each is a homogeneous national unit. But before you lump distinct and diverse national units together in one state, the consent of each of them is indispensable. Otherwise, the seed of social disquilibrium in the new state would have been sown.  On the other hand, if the COR State is created by decree after the Eastern Region shall have made its severance from Nigeria effective, we should then be waging an unjust war against a foreign state. It would be an unjust war, because the purpose of it would be to remove 10 minorities in the East from the dominance of the Ibos only to subordinate them to the dominance of the Efik/Ibibio/Annang national group. I think I have said enough to demonstrate that any war against the East, or vice versa, on any count whatsoever, would be an unholy crusade, for which it would be most unjustifiable to shed a drop of Nigerian blood. Therefore, only a peaceful solution must be found, and quickly too to arrest the present rapidly deteriorating stalemate and restore normalcy.  With regard to the second categorical imperative, it is my considered view that whilst some of the demands of the East are excessive within the context of a Nigerian union, most of such demands are not only wellfounded, but are designed for smooth and steady association amongst the various national units of Nigeria.  The dependence of the Federal Government on financial contributions from the regions? These and other such like demands I do not support. Demands such as these, if accepted, will lead surely to the complete disintegration of the Federation which is not in the interest of our people. But I wholeheartedly support the following demands among others, which we consider reasonable and most of which are already embodied in our memoranda to the Ad Hoc Committee....  That revenue should be allocated strictly on the basis of derivation; that is to say after the Federal Government has deducted its own share for its own services the rest should be allocated to the regions to which they are attributable.  That the existing public debt of the Federation should become the responsibility of the regions on the basis of the location of the projects in respect of each debt whether internal or external.  That each region should have and control its own militia and police force.  That, with immediate effect, all military personnel should be posted to their regions of origin....  If we are to live in harmony one with another as Nigerians it is imperative that these demands and others which are not related, should be met without further delay by those who have hitherto resisted them. To those who may argue that the acceptance of these demands will amount to transforming Nigeria into a federation with a weak central government, my comment is that any link however tenuous, which keeps the East in the Nigerian union, is better in my view than no link at all.  Before the Western delegates went to Lagos to attend the meetings of the ad hoc committee, they were given a clear mandate that if any region should opt out of the Federation of Nigeria, then the Federation should be considered to be at an end, and that the Western Region and Lagos should also opt out of it. It would then be up to Western Nigeria and Lagos as an independent sovereign state to enter into association with any of the Nigerian units of its own choosing, and on terms mutually acceptable to them. I see no reason for departing from this mandate. If any region in Nigeria considers itself strong enough to compel us to enter into association with it on its own terms, I would only wish such a region luck. But such luck, I must warn, will, in the long run be no better than that which has attended the doings of all colonial powers down the ages. This much I must say in addition, on this point. We have neither military might nor the overwhelming advantage of numbers here in Western Nigeria and Lagos. But we have justice of a noble and imperishable cause on our side, namely: the right of a people to unfettered self-determination. If this is so, then God is on our side, and if God is with us then we have nothing whatsoever in this world to fear.  The fourth imperative, and the second conditional one has been fully dealt with in my recent letter to the Military Governor of Western Nigeria, Col. Robert Adebayo, and in the representation which your deputation made last year to the head of the Federal Military Government, Lt. Col. Yakubu Gowon. As a matter of fact, as far back as November last year a smaller meeting of leaders of thought in this Region decided that unless certain things were done, we would no longer participate in the meeting of the ad hoc committee. But since then, not even one of our legitimate requests has been granted. I will, therefore, take no more of your time in making further comments on a point with which you are well familiar. As soon as our humble and earnest requests are met, I shall be ready to take my place on the ad hoc committee. But certainly, not before.  In closing, I have this piece of advice to give. In order to resolve amiably and in the best interests of all Nigerians certain attributes are required on the part of Nigerian leaders, military as well as non-military leaders alike, namely: vision, realism and unselfishness. But above all , what will keep Nigerian leaders in the North and East unwaveringly in the path of wisdom, realism and moderation is courage and steadfastness on the part of Yoruba people in the course of what they sincerely believe to be right, equitable and just. In the past five years we in the West and Lagos have shown that we possess these qualities in a large measure. If we demonstrate them again as we did in the past, calmly and heroically, we will save Nigeria from further bloodshed and imminent wreck and, at the same time, preserve our freedom and self-respect into the bargain.  May God rule and guide our deliberations here, and endow all the Nigerian leaders with the vision, realism, and unselfishness as well as courage and steadfastness in the course of truth, which the present circumstances demand.

Get It Together: Troubling Tales From The Liberal Fringe By Jesse Watters"Get It Together: Troubling Tales from the Liberal Fringe pdf Can the political be way too personal? Download  Have you ever wondered where radical activists get their ideas from? Do their political positions come from careful study or personal experiences? In his book, Get It Together, Jesse Watters explores the personal stories behind some of the most radical activists in the country. Uncovering the Human Side of Activism As a New York Times bestselling author and Fox News primetime host, Watters dives deep into the world of activism and discovers that behind the loud messages and strong opinions, there are often personal struggles and traumas. Through in-depth interviews, he uncovers how childhood traumas, broken relationships, and a lack of introspection shape the beliefs and actions of these activists. A Deeper Understanding Watters challenges the idea that activism is solely driven by ideology. Instead, he suggests that many activists are motivated by personal pain and a desire for change in their own lives. By sharing the stories of individuals working towards causes like climate change salvation, Black supremacy, and social justice, Watters sheds light on the emotional and personal motivations behind their activism. Looking Inward One of the key takeaways from Get It Together is the importance of self-reflection. Watters argues that before trying to change the world, individuals need to address their own internal struggles and traumas. By focusing on personal growth and healing, activists can create more meaningful and sustainable change in their communities and society as a whole. Moving Beyond Division In a time of intense political polarization, Get It Together offers a fresh perspective on how we view our political opponents. By recognizing the humanity and vulnerability of those we disagree with, we can start to bridge the divide and have more productive conversations. Watters reminds us that at the core, we are all human beings with our own struggles and stories. Conclusion: Embracing Empathy In a world filled with division and conflict, Get It Together urges us to approach activism and politics with empathy and understanding. By acknowledging the personal journeys and struggles of those on the other side of the aisle, we can find common ground and work towards a more united and compassionate society.Images: ['https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/18208123_81uxn1lvsml_sl1500_jpeg600afe1cb26375aa918259e0bdc925c1']""False"
Tanko Yakasai's Hate Message Against Igbos?"In A message he wrote yesterday 14th April 2023 in Sulenkuka 4 Governor 2023 Whatsapp Group , the elder Statesman Alhaji Tanko Yakasai OFR opines a shocking ethnic slur against his fellow countrymen - the Igbos. Where are we heading to. Read:    'Nagari Chinese in Nigeria will never be in the position to be indigenes of Nigeria only a few will. They will always need to partner with other Nigerians and majority of them will altimately return to their home after getting what initially attracted them to come to Nigeria. In that case Igbos will have to compete with them and other Nigerians. Such competition will minimize the chances and the advantages the Igbos are presently enjoying in the country. That is not all, the participation of the Chinese in the economic and business competition in Nigeria and its neighboring African countries will have the tandency to squeeze the opportunities the Igbos are presently exploiting in their capacity as indigenes in the country. Besides, other Nigerians who will naturally work together with the Chinese will in the process develop their capabilities and capabilities in the competition more than they are doing hetherto. This scenario will seriously and altimately shrink the size of the Igbo capability in the competition to the advantage of the incoming Chinese and their Nigerian collaborators. To me this is as clear as daylight. I pray that sensible Igbo compatriots will have a look at this debate critically and do the needful when it is not too late for all of us. Regards. Tanko Yakasai OFR.'

British rule in Lagos 1861-1960"British Rule in Lagos: A Multifaceted Lens.   The British presence in Lagos, stretching from 1861 to 1960, was a multifaceted phenomenon brimming with progress and exploitation, opportunity and dispossession.  Understanding its lasting impact necessitates examining both sides of the coin.  From Trading Post to Colonial Capital:   The initial foray, driven by the desire to suppress the slave trade, culminated in the 1861 annexation of Lagos through the infamous Lagos Treaty of Cession. Early colonial rule focused on transforming Lagos into a thriving port city, laying the groundwork for its future economic prominence. Projects like the Eko Bridge symbolized both expansion and the growing integration of Lagos into the British imperial network.  This growth, however, wasn't without its costs. While exports like palm oil and cocoa boomed, often enriching European merchants, local farmers and traders were often unfairly squeezed, forced to navigate an uneven playing field.

We Won't Allow NLC, Others Plunge Nigeria Into Anarchy, CSO Forum Warns"Youths under the platforms of Nigeria Civil Society Forum (NCSF), Friday trouped out in large numbers in Abuja, in a solidarity rally for President Bola Ahmed Tinubu and his administration.  The youths in their thousands, carrying various anti-Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) placards, urged Nigerians to ignore call by the Labour Union leaders for a nationwide protest against hunger.  Speaking with newsmen at the Unity Fountain, a Co-convener of the forum, Comrade Sunday Attah, said Nigerian youths won't allow the NLC and their collaborators to plunge Nigeria into anarchy.  Attah said: 'We must understand the trajectory of how the NLC has operated over time. Remember in this same country when fuel subsidy was removed they got up and claim to be standing for Nigerians. They fought and said fuel subsidy should not be removed but after series of meetings, which of course today they are saying didn't yield any fruit, we know how these 'colour' paper exchanged hands and matters died on the ground.  'We are not going to allow the NLC to plunge Nigeria into anarchy. Calling for protest against an eight months old government is uncalled for.  'The President is doing all his best, he is not a magician, all that Nigerians need at the moment is to be patient with president. When a woman gets pregnant it takes nine months for her to deliver and when the child is born it takes another one to two years for the child to walk. Why don't NLC support Mr President to deliver dividends of democracy and to fulfill all his campaign promises.  'What the NLC is doing is to play the normal card of get the sympathy of Nigeria, go behind negotiate and collect money. President Bola Ahmed Tinubu is not that kind of president. He wants to work for all Nigerians and this is the reason why the president said give me time. My policies may take a little time for us to adjust. These things happened even in civilised societies where government policies do not start manifesting and yielding fruits over night it takes a little process of time and that is the process we are at the moment.  'Today we heard that State governors are not finding it difficult to pay salaries. For example my state where I come from, the governor pays on 25th of the month. That is because the allocations going to states has been increased by Mr President, courtesy of all the reforms that he has brought.'  Also speaking, the Convener of the CSO forum, Comrade Terrence Kuanum, gave the Union leaders 24 hours to rescind the decision of the protest and go back to the negociating table with the government.  According to Kaunum, Nigerians are truly hungry but it is not by sabotaging the system or antagonising the system that we can resolve this issue.  He said: 'So we are suspecting that for NLC that within the ranks of government, because if you call a strike today you will expect government to sit with you on the table and negotiate. You are already at the table with the government, all of us want you to bring solution from that negotiation table so that Nigerians will cushion the effects of what they're going through and we want this process to be properly done so that nobody will go anywhere sabotaging the system. We are against sabotage in the system.  'I am hungry, you are hungry but is not by sabotaging the system or antagonising the system that we can resolve this issue. We can only resolve this issue as patriotic Nigerians that are concerned that we need to resolve this problem and the generation next to us doesn't face it.  'We are giving them 24 hours to rescind the decision of the protest and go back to the table that we have agreed that they should be on it. If they come out we are calling on Nigerians not to respect any decision that will come from NLC and TUC because we are going to mobilise the masses to stay back and work for this country. No strike can solve this problem. You go on strike to get the attention of policy makers, you are already with the policy makers so what is the essence of the strike if not that someone is sponsoring a sabotage.'Images: ['https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/18147512_img20240223wa0048_jpeg309438725ec228a743abb2d5377ef759']"{'comment_topic': 'We Won't Allow NLC, Others Plunge Nigeria Into Anarchy, CSO Forum Warns', 'comment_text': 'Is better, let hunger lead them to anarchy.'}"False"

Still on the course of my morning walk today, I doubled back and went through Ìbarà GRA after Shonekan's house and made a detour through MKO Abiola Stadium to burst out at Kuto Market/Garage areas. The walk took me through the high-density and rough ends of Ìsábò and eventually back to 'town' in the Oke-Ilewo axis. I derive an undescribable pleasure from these early morning walks, they are good for my nerves and my mental stability. I do lots of great thinking during the walks. I took observe my people as they went through the rat race of life, totally oblivious of the gigantic conspiracies weaving intricately around them. I shook my head in pity for our near future. Too many of my people have eye balls in the sockets on their faces but they are blind still, they can't see and too many have ears plastered on the two sides of their heads yet they are deaf, they dont hear the things humming around them. I wish I could have written in Yoruba but I can't because I most unfortunately don't have such proficiency. Sùgbón o, Yoruba e gbó o!!! Wàhálà ti wà o . Èmò ti wòlú, a fura ni.

Erú bo ÈSÙ o edákun Erú bo ÒGÚN o. Please LISTEN TO ME, my stories shouldn't ever again be classified as 'conspiracy theories' As I write this article the things began to fall in together and making sense to me. We haven't been observant at all, even our so-called Eggheads have just been frying the eggs in their heads. Why should it be me, ordinary me living in one obscure area of Abeokuta, to put together these jigsaw of a puzzle? Please follow me with rapt attention on this. It is long read, I couldn't help it. First, see the diabolic steps we were taken through 1. Introduction of the American style of Democracy, Social Order and brand of Capitalism which were balanced in the iniquitous 1979 CONSTITUTION, and by extension the 1999 revised version is the beginning. 2. Systematic decimation of RURAL COMMUNITIES of Yoruba land by the constant stream of Rural-Urban Migration encouraged by the corruption of the system via the 1979 constitution came into the script. 3.Systematic decimation of the economy of South-West Yoruba land and weaponization of poverty targeted especially at the Yoruba people. This was aided by the decapitation of MANUFACTURING sectors and enabling of IMPORTATION sectors of the igbos, two processes which technically disempowered IGNORANT YORUBAS while empowering the IGBO ZIONISTS 4. The meteoric rise of IGBO ZIONISM which took roots majorly in Lagos and expanding into the SW. It completely drove the Yoruba people into poverty and systemically and progressively displaced them from their LANDS. 5. The sudden elevation of Pentecostalism and Wahhabism [ Both coming through inspiration from America ] which seem to be far more rooted in the SW than any other places. The likes of Adeboye and Oyedepo unwittingly assisted in the RUINING OF OUR SOCIAL AND SPIRITUAL ORDER. It is now that you guys will begin to understand exactly what damage the likes of Pastor Adeboye and Oyedepo have wrought in Yoruba land You see all of these five (5) steps mentioned above added up together to aid the IGBO ZIONISTS AGENDA OVER YORUBA LAND that challenges us today. As I write this article NOW, my mind begins to tell me that there is certainly an element of conspiracy between OLÚSÉGUN OBASANJO [ As HoS between 1976 and 1979 ] AND THE AMERICAN ESTABLISHMENT to manipulate Nigeria into the hands of the IGBO ZIONISTS OBANSANJO CANT BE A YORUBA MAN. HE SURELY MUST HAVE SOME CONNECTIONS WITH THE IGBOS OF ANAMBRA. THE IGBOS OF ANAMBRA HAVE A CONNECTION WITH THE JEWS OF ISRAEL, AT LEAST THEY HAVE READ AND HAVE BEEN USING THE JEWISH ZIONISTS MANUALS OF THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY. INCASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW, AMERICA IS PERMANENTLY PRO-ZIONISTS AND THE IGBOS [ ESPECIALLY OF ANAMBRA] HAVE BEEN FOR NEARLY A CENTURY ALL OVER AMERICA TAKING UP STRATEGIC POSITIONING. IGBOS HAVE BEEN THERE SINCE THE 1930s DURING THE TIME OF AZIKIWE AND NWAFOR ORIZU. THEY WERE MORE OR LESS THE ONLY NIGERIANS GOING TO THE USA IN THOSE DAYS!!! Today, you want to remember the likes of Arunma Oteh, Oscar Onyema, Ngozi Okonjo- Iweala, Oby Ezekwesili and many others who held and/or still hold strategic positions in the US and UN. Bola Tinubu in the 1970s must be one of the early sets of Yorubas who thought to go to the US for school. It wasn't common in those days for Yoruba students to school in the US. YORUBAS had their minds fixed on the UK and EUROPE. I strongly believe that Asíwájú Bola Tinubu stumbled on some knowledge, experience or information or all of the above which gave him insights into the connection of the American/Igbo Zionist agenda over Nigeria. From DAY ONE in 1992 when Tinubu got into Nigerian Politics he has been working towards CHECKMATING THE ZIONISTS. The ZIONISTS knew who Tinubu was, also that he knew what they knew and they hated him for that. It has to be the reason Obasanjo hated him too. PLEASE ENDEAVOR TO VERIFY EVERYTHING I WRITE. LET US BE LEARNING TOGETHER. These things are adding up. I knew this day will come. I saw it since 1990/1991 and I was telling my people. For many years, since 2001 I was constantly begging the ÀWÓRÌ Elders of Ojo. They didnt listen to me because I was at the time just a 30-year old, jobbless squatter. I saw this day coming. It is BAD NOW but it is isn't ROTTEN YET. We can still reset things before it gets rotten. I will tell you again what THE IGBO ZIONISTS are doing and exactly what they will do in the coming days or years. Trust me, IF YOU LEAVE THE ZIONISTS TO THEIR SCHEMES AND ANTICS, ESPECIALLY AFTER THIS 2023 REVELATIONS, in another FOUR (4) MAXIMUM, the story in Yoruba land will be so bad we will rely totally on our ancestors, the same ones that we have disconnected from for over 200years but who have been long-suffering and merciful on us. THE SET UP. 1. Remember i have told you SEVERALLY that the IGBOS OF NIGERIA ARE ACTING OUT IN-TOTO THE JEWISH ZIONIST SCRIPT OF 1908-1948 [ 40 YEARS ] **First and foremost, the Igbo Zionism in Nigeria effectively commenced around 1983 [ it is 40 YEARS IN 2023 ] 2. The Jewish Zionism started with the pronouncement in 1897 by Theodore Herzl that the Jews needed to make PALESTINE THEIR HOMELAND. At the time he made that statement it sounded EXTREMELY CRAZY. **In Nigeria it started with the pronouncement by Nnamdi Azikiwe in the 1940s that ' Nigeria was the INHERITANCE of the Igbo people'. It was then immediately followed by the pronouncement by Jaja Wachukwu that 'Lagos was a No Man's Land' Both assertions sounded EXTREMELY CRAZY in the 1940s but they never stopped saying and thinking both. The Igbo Zionists already narrowed in on LAGOS in the 1940s. 3. The Jewish Zionism was powdered by the WORLD JEWRY CALLED ' WORLD JEWISH ZIONISTS' It was headquartered in the US and with branches all over the world at the time. The ZIONISTS Jews had the Leadership of some of the wealthiest men in the world at the time e.g Rockefeller and Rothschild. Those men were American Jews who assimilated and even pretended not to be Jews. **In Nigeria, there is the ' OHANEZE NDIGBO WORLD COUNCIL OF ELDERS' It is also headquartered in the US for OPERATIONS AND FINANCE, IN ANAMBRA FOR SPIRITUAL LEADERSHIP and with branches all over the world at the time. The ZIONISTS Igbos have as their Leadership some of the wealthiest igbo men in the world e.g Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu who are pretending to be 'Nationalists' 4. The operation of the Jewish ZIONIST started with MIGRATION of their population from all over Europe into PALESTINE. They had ENORMOUS FUNDS [ From the WORLD ZIONISTS ] and with that fund they started to buy land PEACEFULLY from the Arabs. They were arriving in 1s, 2s, 10s ,100s and it became 1000s. The ARABS could never have competed with the JEWS WHO HAD TONNES OF FOREIGN DOLLARS FROM THE US WITH THEM. The Arabs were going deeper and deeper into POVERTY so they kept selling and selling LANDS to the Jews who kept buying and buying and kept pushing and pushing the Arabs until the Arabs were displaced from most parts of their lands **The Igbo Zionists of Nigeria did exactly the same,.just substitute Yoruba for the Arabs in the statement above. The Igbos however, and unlike the Jews, got the greater parts of their own ZIONIST FUNDS FROM DRUG TRAFFICKING. 5. By the time the Arabs would wake up the Jews had taken over the Lands and they have manged to change the DEMOGRAPHICS OF PALESTINE. **This is what has happened in Lagos today. 6. When the Arabs tried to revolt as they still had the superiority of Population, the Jews responded: MACABEES were terrorists who had many daredevils in its membership. They TERRORIZED the Arabs silly. HAGANAH was a militia formed along the line. They were the defence forces of the emerging Jewish State. MOSSAD was the deadliest intelligence arm ever built or assembles by any country in the world. The strength of the MOSSAD was derived from the singular fact that the Jews had resources of men and women who could pass FAULTLESSLY FOR ANY TRIBE IN THE WORLD, INCLUDING ALL ARAB TRIBES It was very easy for the Jews to slip into any country of the Arabs and blended totally into their system and lived there while MINING INFORMATION to destroy them. The Arabs were also a very careless, easy-going, fair-minded and simple people whose nature made them vulnerable in the hands of the Jews who came to them with a deadly mission of conquer. ** This is EXACTLY what the igbos have done in Nigeria, SW IN PARTICULAR. In Nigeria, the Igbos already have the following in place: UGM to act the role of the Macabees. ESN which will metamorphose into Haganah. IPOB already made it clear to you that they are the INTELLIGENCE ARM of the BIAFRAN struggle. There are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of IGBOS who can pass FAULTLESSLY FOR ANY TRIBE IN NIGERIA AND EVEN BEYOND INTO OTHER AFRICAN COUNTRIES. Those guys will slip easily even into the palaces and inner sanctuaries of our Political, Traditional and Spiritual Leaders. We are just as careless, carefree and uselessly complacent as the Arabs. 7. Finally the Jewish ZIONISTS knew they didnt have the power of population and realized it was a disadvantage. They deployed the weapons of BLACKMAIL AND PROPAGANDA. They screamed at the slightest mention of anything relating or connected to the Jews. They regularly went out to provoke the Arabs and still be the first in the news screaming 'antisemitism'. They took over the media and regularly dished out MISINFORMATION. They started asking for PARTITIONING IN PALESTINE They laid claim on Jerusalem even when they knew that Islam's third holiest site was there in Jerusalem not far from the Jew's Wailing Wall. With the support of America and the American Jews [ who controlled America anyway ] they harassed Britain until Lord Balfour had to make the now famous Balfour Declaration of 1917. **.These are the steps that the Igbos are taking, believe me. They are.experts at crying 'Igbo hate' even when they are the ones suffocating you. Those guys have taken up the whole internet and social media and all they do is to spread FLASEHOOD AND REVISIONIST HISTORY. What they want to achieve is a PARTITIONING OF LAGOS INTO IGBO AND YORUBA SECTORS. They are aware of the disadvantage of their population and the fact that they being surrounded by Yoruba States so they have started flanking out to cover the entire Ogun State. THESE GUYS ARE EVIL AND DETERMINED. SOLUTION: 1. Yorubas willingly or unwillingly MUST BE STOPPED from selling landed properties to the igbos. Governments of SW STATES MUST come out with legislation and policies on it. 2. SW Government MUST move immediately to take advantage of the new laws on power generation to jump-start our ailing manufacturing sectors to provide jobs and empowerment for our people. It will also upturn the settings of the ZIONISTS. 3. Lagos State Government MUST IMMEDIATELY recover at least the ALABA INTERNATIONAL, TRADE FAIR [ THROUGH FGN ] AND LADIPO MARKETS. Those markets must be pulled down and the lands taken over by Government for purposes.more beneficial to the Yoruba people. There must not be delay on this. 4. Lagos State in particular and SW STATES in general must begin to work on Legislation and Policies that will discourage unuseful migratory trends into Yoruba land especially of the ZIONISTS. 5.. Ogun State Government is the new target of the ZIONISTS. They are already here mesmerizing our poor folks and buying family houses and lands all over Abeokuta, Ijebu and Yewa with ZIONIST FUNDS. I will keep saying these things because they are serious matters.

How Femi Fani Kayode’s Wife & Daughters Slept With Atiku, Obasanjo, Shama And Co"Femi has finally displayed his wealth of Idio-stupidity…hence his immoral house hood chapter is hereby opened.     1. I have been in dispute with Femi since September 2011 over personal issues.  2. I worked with ObJ between, 2004 to 2007 (Second term) as private in house Agent before leaving to back to Canada in late 2007.  3. I have known Femi since 2002; we first met during an evening Private meeting, on a Sunday at Otta (OBJ’s Parlor).  4. Femi never hide his sexual taste on women (both single and Married. And in many occasions with OBJ, OBJ stylishly joke over Femi’s unending libido on women who rush for assistance, favor or help in Abuja.  5. OBJ calls him “Woman Rapper” and usually warn him to be careful.  6. Many of us including his Aides and OBJ’s Aides knew that Femi is usually on drugs    7. I can categorically state that Femi has slept with the lady (Adaobi Uchegbu) he mentioned on his FB wall, I don’t know about Miss Chioma Anasoh, I have never heard or seen her before but I say he’s only dreaming of sleeping with Bianca. I believe he’s only lying or trying to make his petition against Ibos strong by dragging Bianca to his chains and lists of banged women. Throughout my time with them (OBJ, Atiku, Imoke and Femi), I have never seen or heard of any relationship between him and Bianca. It would be surprising to know that Femi has never in his life met Bianca, because Femi is very good at lies.  8. No doubt Femi has slept with many Nigerian women (Yoruba, Hausa, Ibo, IJaw etc); Married and Unmarried women.  9. He was not only the person that slept with Adaobi Ukaegbu. I have done it with her severally even when Femi was poking her day and night in Abuja. Even many security men have done it with her under Femi’s nose. So I don’t think Femi should make noise about Adaobi. Adaobi to security men who have banged her severally in and outside Villa was seen as one of those Abuja Prostitutes. She and many other ladies even from south west, South-East, South-south and North were just popular to many of us as political sex hankers. Anyone can bang Adaobi and others even just by mentioning that you are a son to a local government chairman, but you must be ready.  10. She (Adaobi) is not alone in warming of Abuja men’s bed, many Yoruba, Hausa, Tiv, Edo etc were all in the same business of being bleeped for one favor or the other. Today, many of them were lucky to head or work in one office or the other as they continue their political bed warming in Abuja.  11. Unfortunately, what Femi doesn’t know is that; while he was busy messing up with people’s wives, girls friends, others were also busy fucking his house hood (his wife and female children) under his nose.  12. I can authoritatively inform you that in two different occasions in 2006; one in Abuja and the other in Saudi Arabia, Former VP (Atiku) wiped Regina (Femi’s wife). Madam Regina Fani-Kayode is also a hot pant and money hunger just like her husband Femi.  13. Femi has five beautiful daughters and I can authoritatively inform you that OBJ has severally slept with Regina and Oluwafolake (Femi’s first daughter).  14. Femi’s daughters; Oluwafolake, who’s mostly called (Folake) and Oluwatemitope who’s mostly called (Temi) are Bi-Sex, and worst of it they are into incest relationship. Two one them have been caught severally making things out on the bed by their own father, who is also crazy about sex and drugs.  15. I, personally have banged Folake, and Temi, but my other colleague has banged Femi’s second to the youngest daughter of his second divorced wife; Oluwatobiloba, who at her prime age love sex more than food.  16. Femi might be aware of the sexual relationship between his wife, daughter with OBJ. He has in some occasions quarreled with Regina and threatens her of Divorce, but for the sake of OBJ and his job, Femi kept mute.  17. In October 2010 during Femi’s private dinner for his 50th birthday, Regina went home with OBJ and spent the Night with him while Femi was busy bedding Adaobi who assisted very well for the social event. Adaobi case nearly destroyed Femi’s home as his wife usually use her as an excuse of sexual immorality even with young campus boys and ex-boy friends.  18. In 2007, one of the security men who has severally banged Femi’s daughter Temi was caught happily showcasing his big black dick to another Femi’s daughter Oluwatuminu during her holiday break, which she admired with smile. They were caught on a newly installed CCTV and the young man was fired thereafter.  19. The only daughter from Regina was the only decent girl in Femi’s house, although she’s still growing up.  20. There’s trouble in Femi’s house hood over madness of immorality sexual relationship and drug addicts. Femi has personally told me when things were okay between us that “Women are only tools for enjoyment”. He said he divorced his first wife (Saratu) the late 1990 over trust. Saratu who I met once was Folake’s mother, even though they have divorce and the woman remarried, Femi still bang her whenever she visit Abuja as I know in 2006.  21. Femi’s second marriage lasted only five years (1991 – 1995 as I later knew) with three daughters; Oluwatemitope, Oluwatobiloba and Oluwatuminu. He’s divorced second wife Yemisi Olasunbo Adeniji once accused him of sleeping with their first Oluwatemitope(Temi), although she’s no longer his wife, Femi usually demand sex from her which to my knowledge the woman never give in but have slept severally with Femi’s friends and politicall associate.  22. Regina Fani-Kayode (nee Regina patience Amonoo), Femi’s third and present wife have also been accused by Femi of sleeping with his brother Rotimi Fani-Kayode. Regina who had only one daughter; Oluwaremilekun for Femi has been warned by Femi not to operate or open FaceBook account, because Femi thinks she will end up getting dating more young guys on internet.  23. I can state here that Femi’s marriage with Regina will still not last. The lady is also smart and sexually active like Femi. Femi hasn’t divorce her yet because he’s still eating through her as the Lady keeps secret dates with top politicians, makes money and ready to fix Femi too politically. OBJ’s relationship with Femi has been cordial because of this lady who warms OBJ ‘s bed regularly. The same lady has been making personally effort with GEJ for herself and probably for fix for Femi.  24. Finally, I have never banged Femi’s third wife Regina but I can say she’s a nice woman in her good side, though I have enjoyed nice sexual views of her. Seen her being banged by VP and Presido and assisted her many times with her clothes. My problem with them is that they are ingrates. Thanks for their daughters who made me happy several times with their tits, pussy and mouths. There’s no need throwing stone when you have so many glass houses. Nigeria MUST remain One. Those preaching division from south-south and south-East are wasting their time.  -  Source: https://www.facebook.com/shama.maliga   A"{'comment_topic': 'How Femi Fani Kayode’s Wife & Daughters Slept With Atiku, Obasanjo, Shama And Co', 'comment_text': 'baba nla rubbish, so what has all these got to do with ordinary Nigerians'}, {'comment_topic': 'How Femi Fani Kayode’s Wife & Daughters Slept With Atiku, Obasanjo, Shama And Co', 'comment_text': 'Someone's gone mashuguna!
